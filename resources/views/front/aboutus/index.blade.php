                                        UPX was set up in 2018 after 4 friends got together and 
                                        decided to change the door to door courier service. 
                                        With over 30 years’ experience between us, we 
                                         realized that the market needed radical changes. For too long, 
                                         customers have suffered with lack of options, lack of clarity on pricing 
                                         and lack of service for the parcels that they need to send worldwide.
                                         <br>
                                         “The major thing that is lacking in this SERVICE INDUSTRY is the SERVICE itself”.
                                         <br>
                                         And that is where UPX comes into play – we are shaking the industry by providing a service that all our competitors inspire towards.
